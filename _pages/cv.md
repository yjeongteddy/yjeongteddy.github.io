Research Experience
======
* Research Engineer @ Hydraulic and Coastal Engineering Research Group, Inc. (Jun. 2023 - Present)
  * Provide engineering solutions for coastal hazard mitigation
  * Perform high-resolution numerical modeling of hydro-meteorological extremes under a warming climate
  * Conduct quantitative analysis on potential risks of coastal disasters and establish future projections
  * Experience in an on-premises HPC environment

* Research Intern @ Ocean Observation Lab., Seoul National University (Jan. 2022 - Feb. 2023)
  * Conducted ship-based observations and performed QA/QC on acquired data
  * Investigated small- to regional-scale oceanographic phenomena

* Research Intern @ Ocean Climate Dynamics Lab., Chungnam National University (Dec. 2020 - Dec. 2021)
  * Examined the variability of the main axis location of the Kurishio Current using machine learning
  * Analyzed heat transport fluctuations of the Kuroshio Current related to atmospheric forcing
  
Projects
======
* Flooding Risk Assessment for Nuclear Power Plant Sites @ HYCERG Inc. (Jun. 2023 - Present)
  * Aimed to estimate potential maximum and minimum sea levels associated with coastal disasters and to establish future inundation projections based on climate change scenarios
  * Created intensified tropical cyclone meteorological fields using the Advanced Research WRF
  * Simulated the spatiotemporal distribution of storm surge and wind-driven waves using ADCIRC and SWAN
  * Determined expected total water levels
* Mixing processes in the Japan/East Sea @ OOL (Jan. 2022 - Feb. 2023)
  * Investigated topography-induced diapycnal mixing processes at the entrance of the Korea/Tsushima Strait using observational data collected by CTD, ADCP, and VMP
  * Developed computational algorithms for estimating the rate of turbulent dissipation without microstructure observations
